<p> I was born in Mountain View, California on August 1st, 2002. I grew up in the Evergreen suburbs in San Jose. I attended Silver Oak Elementary School, Chaboya Middle School, and Archbishop Mitty High School. In middle school, I played soccer and ran cross country and track. In high school, I played soccer and ran cross country until I tore my ACL, MCL, and mensicus all at once. After this injury I joined the speech and debate team.</p>
<p> My places of employment as a teenager were as follows:
	<ul> 
		<li>Rockin' Jump Trampoline Park</li>
		<li>Jamba Juice</li>
		<li>Black Angus Steakhouse</li>
	</ul>
<p>My favorite pizza place from home is Bibo's NY Pizza. My dad is friends with the owner's brother. Check out their website here: <a href="https://bibosnypizza-birdave.square.site">Bibo's NY Pizza</a></p>
<p>My parents made the decision to move to Fort Collins, Colorado in the summer of 2021.</p>
<p>My freshman year at Syracuse University I lived in Day Hall. This year I am living in Watson Hall.</p>
